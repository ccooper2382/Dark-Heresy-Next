            <p>Adepts are wise and learned scholars, at least they hope to
            be one day. They are skilled with languages, knowledge and
            often act as the brains of the group. They are not very good
            at fighting, and some are very poor at talking to people.
            When it comes to the realm of the mind however, they leave
            everyone else for dust.</p>
